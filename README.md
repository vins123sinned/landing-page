A project that creates a basic web page design using HTML and CSS

This projects builds up on everything that I have learned about HTML and CSS from the foundations path up until this point, with additional elements and styles that I would learn by using google. This project aims to reinforce my knowledge of creating HTML pages and its structure along with the newly introduced CSS flexbox in order to make styling web pages much easier. From creating a boilerplate to finishing up to styling to be as close to possible to the reference, this project is aimed at challenging me to create things from scratch which will be the first thing that any programmer should do when starting on their project.

By the end of this project, I will have reinforced and learned new things about HTML and CSS. From creating sections of a website to styling them, this project's completion will be able to prepare me for Javascript as a fundamental knowledge of HTML and CSS is essential before learning about Javascript and how it can be used to manipulate and make websites/webpages so much more interactive and engaging.
